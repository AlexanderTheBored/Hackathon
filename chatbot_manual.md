## Tips for Using ZoneGuide

1. **Layer Combinations:** Try combining multiple layers (e.g., Flood Risk + 3D Terrain) to understand how elevation affects flooding

2. **Project Planning:** Use the Project Filter to quickly identify suitable zones for your development type

3. **Risk Assessment:** Check both the zoning layer and flood risk layer for any location you're interested in

4. **Historical Context:** Pay attention to "last incident" dates in flood zone popups to understand recent flood patterns

5. **Seasonal Awareness:** Flood risks increase during typhoon season (June-November) and monsoon periods
